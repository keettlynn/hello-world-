# hello-world-
first task keettlynn ever done in the PC programming world

First thing to start my day is a strong, hot, unsweetened coffee, no milk on it. Or maybe two scoops of legend pre training powder. Depends on how much spare time I have when I wake up.
My car is always playing great music, rock and roll or classic music, either way only the best.
